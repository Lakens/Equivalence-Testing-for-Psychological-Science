We see that indeed, all effect size estimates are measured with such
high precision, we can conclude that they fall within the equivalence
bound of d = -0.1 and d = 0.1. However, note that all of the effects are
also statistically significant - so, the the effects are statistically
different from zero, and practically equivalent.

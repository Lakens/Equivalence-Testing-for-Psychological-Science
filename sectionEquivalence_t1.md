Equivalence test for correlations
=================================

\label{equivalence-test-for-correlations}

 

Olson, Fazio, and Hermann (2007) reported correlations between implicit
and explicit measures of self-esteem, such as the IAT, Rosenberg’s
self-esteem scale, a feeling thermometer, and trait ratings. In Study 1
71 participants completed the self-esteem measures. Because no
equivalence bounds are mentioned, we can see which equivalence bounds
the researchers would have 80% power to detect.

    ## The required sample size to achieve 80 

    ## [1] 70.05703

With 71 pairs of observations between measures, the researchers have 80%
power for equivalence bounds of r = -0.24 and r = 0.24.

The correlations observed by Olson et al (2007), Study 1, are presented
in the table below (significant correlations are flagged by an
asteriks).

With 19 to 21 participants in each between subject condition, the study
had 80% power to detect equivalence with equivalence bounds of -0.68 to
d = 0.68.

When we perform 5 equivalence tests using equivalence bounds of -0.68
and 0.68, using a Holm-Bonferroni sequential procedure to control error
rates, we can conclude statistical equivalence for the data in row 1, 3,
and 6, but the conclusion is undetermined for tests 2 and 4, where the
data is neither significantly different from guessing average, nor
statistically equivalent. For example, performing the test for the data
in row 6:

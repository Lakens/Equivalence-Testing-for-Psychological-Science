Independent Groups Welch’s Equivalence Test
-------------------------------------------

\label{independent-groups-welchs-equivalence-test}

Deary, Thorpe, Wilson, Starr, and Whally (2003) report the IQ scores of
79,376 children in Scotland (39,343 girls and 40,033 boys). The IQ score
for girls (M = 100.64, SD = 14.1) girls and boys (100.48, SD = 14.9) was
non-significant. With such a huge sample, we can examine whether the
data is equivalent using very small equivalence bounds, such as -0.05
and 0.05. Because sample sizes are unequal, and variances are unequal,
Welch’s t-test is used, and we can conclude IQ scores are indeed
equivalent, based on equivalence bounds of -0.05 and 0.05.
